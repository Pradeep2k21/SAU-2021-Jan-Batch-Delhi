        <div class="newsContent col-md-11 bg-light">
            
            <p> <p1>New Delhi: </p1>The ninth round of discussion between farmers demanding repeal of the three agriculture laws and the centre -- held days after the Supreme Court stayed their enactment "until further orders" -- ended today with no progress towards ending the stalemate.
            </p>
            <p> "It was a 120 per cent failure. We suggested that the government remove the changes made to the Essential Commodities Act instead of scrapping it altogether. But the Agriculture Minister has not said anything on this," farmer leader Dr Darshanpal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leaders of the 40 farmers' unions negotiating with the centre also said they want continued direct communication with the centre, "not brokers". They maintain they will not appear before the panel since the members were already in "favour of the farm laws".
            </p>
            <p>
                "The government and farmers should continue looking for solutions, formally and informally. Whatever we can agree on during these talks will decide the future course of action. The government is committed to follow the Supreme Court's order," Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.
            </p>
            <p>Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping around Delhi since November 26 demanding repeal of three farm laws saying they would leave them vulnerable to exploitation. The centre has maintained the laws would open new markets and increase their income by eliminating middlemen.</p>
